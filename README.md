# CurrencyCalculator

A currency calculator made using Flutter

## Description

I used https://exchangeratesapi.io/ (https://github.com/exchangeratesapi/exchangeratesapi) for this app, i recommend this API to everyone. My motivation for creating it is beacuse i speak with foreigners alot, and when we talk about stuff like money or prices, i always convert my country's currency to their one so they will always have a better view of how much something costs.
